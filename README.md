# crystalWebcomicScraper

Just a quick generic multi-purpose comic scraper. Currently it works for only a small set of comics, but with an identifier algo instead of or beside the user input for XML, it would be much better.

## Installation

No clue. I guess it needs the Crystal compiler, and uses the Crystagiri shard.

## Usage

Run from terminal, follow the instructions.

## Development

If for some reason this project interests you, go ahead, give me a request, but it really just is a little side project.
